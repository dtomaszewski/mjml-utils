The utility belt for [MJML2](https://mjml.io/) developers

based on [mjml-utils](https://github.com/justinsisley/mjml-utils)

## Installation

Installing globally is the easiest way to get started, since you won't need any project-specific setup:

```bash
npm install -g mjml-utils-2
```

Installing as a local dev-dependency gives you more flexibility:

```bash
npm install -D mjml-utils-2
```

If you install __mjml-utils__ locally, you'll probably want to configure it to run via your `package.json` scripts. This method is encouraged, and an example of local usage via `package.json` scripts is provided [below](#npm-script-usage).

## Global Usage

#### --build

The `mju --build` command compiles all MJML templates into HTML templates.

```bash
mju --build -i ./templates -o ./build
```

The `--build` command requires input (`-i`) and output (`-o`) arguments. `-i` is the directory in which your raw MJML templates are located, and `-o` is the directory you would like the compiled HTML files written to.

#### --watch

The `mju --watch` command will monitor all MJML templates in a specified directory and compile them to HTML every time they're modified.

```bash
mju --watch -i ./templates -o ./build
```

Like the `--build` command, the `--watch` command requires both input (`-i`) and output (`-o`) arguments.

#### --send

The `mju --send` command sends compiled MJML templates as HTML emails to a recipient of your choosing using your Gmail credentials.

```bash
mju --send -i -o ./build
```

The `--send` command will prompt you to provide all of the information needed to send test emails.

## NPM Script Usage

If you'd prefer to install __mjml-utils__ locally, you can easily tailor its commands specifically for your project.

For example, if your project contains MJML email templates in the `./templates/email` directory, and you'd like to compile them to the `./build/templates/email` directory, you might configure your `package.json` file like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "email-build": "mju --build -i ./templates/email -o ./build/templates/email",
    "email-watch": "mju --watch -i ./templates/email -o ./build/templates/email",
    "email-send": "mju --send -o ./build/templates/email"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "mjml": "*",
    "mjml-utils": "*"
  }
}
```

The above configuration would allow you to run the following commands from the command line:

```bash
npm run email-build
npm run email-watch
npm run email-send
```

This is the preferred way of using __mjml-utils__, since you can configure it on a per-project basis, and you won't have to remember any command line arguments other than the simple NPM script alias.
